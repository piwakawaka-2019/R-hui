# Rāhui

# Final Group Project

Rāhui

1. (verb) (-ngia,-tia) to put in place a temporary ritual prohibition, closed season, ban, reserve - traditionally a rāhui was placed on an area, resource or stretch of water as a conservation measure or as a means of social and political control for a variety of reasons which can be grouped into three main categories: pollution by tapu, conservation and politics.

This App will attempt to provide an API resource that allows Iwi to geo-locate and display knowledge and other recommendations related to Whenua (land) such as Rāhui. 

This is an app to display Rāhui and other concerns in cartographic format.

The idea of the App is to be able to display current Rāhui and to be able to Tautoko or support certain Rāhui. A user can sign up by listing their iwi affiliation and biographical information. A registered user can then create and locate a rāhui.
