          <p>
            A Rāhui is a ritual prohibition that is used to restrict the use of natural resources for a period of time. It is also imposed in the case of a Tangi. Death pollutes land, water and people through Tapu. When Tapu has been breached, Rāhui is then put in place so balance can be restored and returned to a state of Noa. A Rāhui may be placed on forests, food gathering areas, rivers, lakes or the sea, and may be placed for a variety of reasons such as claiming ownership, respecting the site of a recent death, the need to replenish food stocks or resources in an area, or to prevent the risk or spread of disease. The power of a Rāhui comes from the Mana of the person or group that impose it. For that reason, Rāhui can only exist under the mantle of the Mana Whenua.

            Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born
            as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and
            it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a
            curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency
            with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it
            looks pretty real.
