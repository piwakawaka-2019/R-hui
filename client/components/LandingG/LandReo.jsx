            TO BE TRANSLATED - A Rāhui is a ritual prohibition that is used to restrict the use of natural resources for a period of time. It is also imposed in the case of a Tangi. Death pollutes land, water and people through Tapu. When Tapu has been breached, Rāhui is then put in place so balance can be restored and returned to a state of Noa. A Rāhui may be placed on forests, food gathering areas, rivers, lakes or the sea, and may be placed for a variety of reasons such as claiming ownership, respecting the site of a recent death, the need to replenish food stocks or resources in an area, or to prevent the risk or spread of disease. The power of a Rāhui comes from the Mana of the person or group that impose it. For that reason, Rāhui can only exist under the mantle of the Mana Whenua.
