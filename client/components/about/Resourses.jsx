              Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born
              as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and
              it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a
              curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency
              with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it
              looks pretty real.” As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.” The
              placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit
              amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in
              its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin. Richard McClintock, a
              Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with
              discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In
              seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
              consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin
              dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
              Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C.
              text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
